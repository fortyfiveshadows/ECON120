### Economics: Foundations and Models
___
- In a *market system*, firms respond to economic incentives.
- To attain our goals, we must make choices. We must make choices because we live in a world of *scarcity*, which means that although our wants are *unlimited*, the resources available to fulfill those wants are *limited*. Every day, you make choices as you spend your limited income on the many goods and services available. The finite amount of time you have also limits your ability to attain your goals.
- The three key economic ideas:
	1. People are rational.
		- Economists assume that consumers and firms use all available information as they act to achieve their goals. Rational individuals weigh the benefits and costs of each action, and they choose an action only if the benefits outweigh the costs. Although not everyone behaves rationally all the time, the assumption of rational behavior is very useful in explaining most of the choices that people make.
	1. People respond to economic incentives.
		- While not ignoring other motives, economists emphasize that consumers and firms consistently respond to economic incentives. 
	2. Optimal decisions are made at the margin.
		- By "made at the margin," we mean that most decisions in life involve doing a little more or doing a little less. Economists use the word *marginal* to mean "extra" or "additional." 
		- Economists reason that the optimal decision is to continue any activity up to the point where the marginal benefit equals the marginal cost - where MB = MC.
		- Economists refer to analysis that involves comparing marginal benefits and marginal costs as **marginal analysis**.
- The three fundamental questions that any economy must answer:
	1. What goods and services will be produced?
		- The answer to the question of what will be produced is determined by the choices that consumers and people working for firms or the government make. 
	2. How will the goods and services be produced?
		- Firms choose how to produce the goods and services they sell. In many cases, firms face a trade-off between using more workers and using more machines. 
	3. Who will receive the goods and services produced?
		- In the U.S., who receives the goods and services produced depends largely on how income is distributed. The higher a person's income, the more goods, and services he or she can buy. 
	- Any society faces the economic problem that it has only a limited amount of economic resources (e.g., workers, machines, raw materials, etc) and it can also only produce a limited amount of goods and services. Thus, every society faces *trade-offs*: producing more of one good or service means producing less of another good or service. The *opportunity cost* of any activity (e.g., producing a good or service) is the highest-valued alternative that must be given up to engage in the activity.
 - Centrally Planned Economies vs. Market Economies
	 - A society can have a *centrally planned economy* in which the government decides how economic resources will be allocated or a society can have a *market economy* in which the decisions of households and firms interacting in markets allocate economic resources. 
	 - The standard of living of the average person in a centrally planned economy tends to be low. All centrally planned economies have also been political dictatorships. Only North Korea still has a completely centrally planned economy.
	 - All high-income democracies (e.g., U.S., Canada, Western Europe, etc) have market economies, which rely primarily on privately owned firms to produce goods and services and to decide how to produce them.  Markets (vs. the government) determine who receives the goods and services produced. In a market economy, firms must produce goods and services that meet the wants of consumers, or the firms will go out of business. In that way, it is ultimately consumers who decide what goods and services will be produced. As firms in a market economy compete to offer the highest quality products at the lowest price, they are under pressure to use the lowest-cost methods of production.
	 - In a market economy, the income of an individual is determined by the payments he receives for what he or she has to sell. One of the attractive features of markets is that they reward hard work. 
- The Modern "Mixed" Economy
	- In the 1930s, the U.S. government established the *Social Security system*, which provides government payments to retired and disabled workers, and enacted a *minimum wage* after a period of time in the 1800s and early 1900s, where it engaged in relatively little regulation of markets. However, it drastically increased due to the high rates of unemployment and business bankruptcies during the Great Depression. 
	- Some economists argue that the extent of government intervention makes it no longer accurate to refer to the economies like the U.S., Canada, Western Europe, etc as market economies. Instead, they should be labeled as *mixed economies*.
- Efficiency and Equity
	- Market economies tend to be more efficient than centrally planned economies. There are two types of efficiency:
	1. Productive efficiency: occurs when a good or service is produced at the lowest possible cost. It is achieved when competition among firms forces them to produce goods and services at the lowest cost.
	3. Allocative efficiency: occurs when production is in accordance with consumer preferences. It is achieved when the combination of competition among firms and voluntary exchange between firms and consumers results in firms producing the mix of goods and services that consumers prefer the most.
	- Markets tend to be efficient because they promote competition and facilitate voluntary exchange - where both the buyer and seller of a product are made better off by the transaction. 
	- Although markets promote efficiency, they don't guarantee it. Inefficiency can arise from various sources. Inefficiency can also arise if governments interfere with voluntary exchange in markets. 
	- Not everyone will consider a particular outcome to be desirable, even if the outcome is economically efficient. Many people prefer economic outcomes that they consider fair or equitable, even if those outcomes are less efficient. 
- Economic Models
	- To develop a model, economists generally follow these steps:
	1. Decide on the assumptions to use.
	2. Formulate a testable hypothesis.
	3. Use economic data to test the hypothesis.
	4. Revise the model if it fails to explain the economic data well.
	5. Retain the revised model to help answer similar economic questions in the future. 
- The Role of Assumptions in Economic Models
	- Economic models make *behavioral assumptions* about the motives of consumers and firms. Economists assume that consumers will buy the goods and services that will maximize their well-being or their satisfaction. 
- Forming and Testing Hypotheses in Economic Models
	- An *economic variable* is something measurable that can have different values, such as the number of people employed in manufacturing. 
	- In an economic model, a hypothesis is a statement about an economic variable that may be either correct or incorrect.
		- Before we can accept a hypothesis, we have to test it by analyzing statistics on the relevant economic variables.

**Economics:** the study of the choices people make to attain their goals, given their scarce resources.
**Economic model:** a simplified version of reality used to analyze real-world economic situations.
**Market:** a group of buyers and sellers of a good or service and the institution or arrangement by which they come together to trade.
**Centrally planned economy:** an economy in which the government decides how economic resources will be allocated.
**Market economy:** an economy in which the decisions of households and firms interacting in markets allocate economic resources. 
**Mixed economy:** an economy in which most economic decisions result from the interaction of buyers and sellers in markets but in which the government plays a significant role in the allocation of resources. 
**Productive efficiency:** a situation in which a good or service is produced at the lowest possible cost.
**Allocative efficiency:** a state of the economy in which production is in accordance with consumer preferences; in particular, every good or service is produced up to the point where the last unit provides a marginal benefit to society equal to the marginal cost of producing it.
