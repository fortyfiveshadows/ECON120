### Trade-offs, Comparative Advantages, and the Market System
___
- Increasing Marginal Opportunity Costs
	- As the economy moves down the production possibilities frontier, it experiences *increasing marginal opportunity costs*.
	- The more resources already devoted to an activity, the smaller the payoff to devoting additional resources to that activity.
- Economic Growth
	- Outwards shifts in the PPF represent economic growth because they allow the economy to increase the production of goods and services, which ultimately raises the standard of living.
	- Markets are fundamentally about trade, which is the act of buying and selling. We often trade indirectly: we sell our labor services and then we use the money earned to buy goods and services. One of the great benefits of trade is that it makes it possible for people to become better off by increasing both their production and their consumption.
- Comparative Advantage and the Gains from Trade
	- The basis for trade is comparative advantage, not absolute advantage. 
- The Market System
	- Trade allows people to specialize according to their comparative advantage. By engaging in trade, people can raise their incomes and their standard of living. 
	- Factors of production are the inputs used to make goods and services, and are divided into four broad categories:
	1. *Labor* includes all types of work, from the part-time labor of teenagers working at McDonald's to the work of senior managers in large corporations.
	2. *Capital* refers to physical capital, such as computers, office buildings, and machine tools, used to produce other goods.
	3. *Natural resources* include land, water, oil, iron ore, and other raw materials that are used in producing goods.
	4. An *entrepreneur* is someone who operates a business. *Entrepreneurial ability* is the ability to bring together the other factors of production to successfully produce and sell goods and services.
- The Circular Flow of Income
	- Two key groups participate in markets:
	1. *Households* are all the individuals in a home (one or several persons). Households are suppliers of factors of production (typically labor) and are typically employed by firms to make goods and services. Households use the income they receive from selling the factors of production to purchase the goods and services supplied by firms. All firms are owned by households. Small firms (e.g., a restaurant) can be owned by one person, whereas large firms (e.g., Apple, Google, Shell, etc) are owned by millions of shareholders.
	2. *Firms* are the suppliers of goods and services. Firms use the funds they receive from selling goods and services to buy or hire the factors of production needed to make the goods and services.
- The Gains from Free Markets
	- Governments in all modern economies intervene more than is consistent with a fully free market. 
	- An early and influential argument for the free market system was Adam Smith's *The Wealth of Nations*, published in 1776. During the time, there were extensive government restrictions on markets, and in many parts of Europe, the *guild system* prevailed. In this system, governments would give guilds (organizations of producers) the authority to control the production of a good (e.g., the shoemaker's guild controlled who was allowed to produce shoes). 
		- Smith argued that such restrictions reduced the income and wealth of a country and its people by restricting the quantity of goods produced.
- The Market Mechanism
	-  A key to Smith's argument is the assumption that *individuals usually act in a rational, self-interested way*. Particularly, individuals take the actions that are most likely to make themselves better off financially. This assumption of rational, self-interested behavior underlies nearly all economic analysis. 
	- For the market mechanism to work in response to changes in consumers' wants, *prices must be flexible*. The *relative price* is the price of one good or service relative to the prices of other goods or services. Changes in relative prices provide information, or a signal, to both consumers and firms. 
	- Economists have used Adam Smith's metaphor of the *invisible hand* to describe how the market leads firms to provide consumers with the goods they want. Firms respond *individually* to changes in prices by making decisions that collectively end up satisfying the preferences of consumers.
- The Role of the Entrepreneur in the Market System
	- *Entrepreneurs* are central to a market system. Entrepreneurs first determine what goods and services they believe consumers want and then decide how to produce those goods and services most profitably, using the available factors of production. Successful entrepreneurs are able to search out opportunities to provide new goods and services, which are frequently created by new technology.  
- The Legal Basis of a Successful Market System
	- In a free market, the government does not restrict how firms produce and sell goods and services or how they employ factors of production. However, the absence of such government restrictions is not enough for the market system to succeed in providing people with a high standard of living. Governments take active steps to provide a *legal environment* that will allow markets to operate efficiently.
	- Protection of Private Property
		- For the market system to work well, individuals must be willing to take risks. 
		- In any modern economy, *intellectual property rights* are very important. Intellectual property includes books, films, software, and ideas for new products or new ways of producing products. To protect intellectual property, the federal government grants a patent that gives an inventor (often a firm) the exclusive right to produce and sell a new product for a period of 20 years from the date the patent was filed.
			- Just as a new product or a new method of making a product receives patent protection, new books, film, or pieces of music have the exclusive right to use the creation during the creator's lifetime. The creator's heirs retain this exclusive right for 70 years after the death of the creator. In providing copyright protection for only a limited time, Congress provides economic incentives to creators while eventually after the creators' works to be freely available to others.
