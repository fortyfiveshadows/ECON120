Economic Efficiency, Government Price Setting, and Taxes
___
- In a competitive market, the price adjusts to ensure that the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied. As a result, every consumer willing to pay the market price is able to buy as much of the product as the consumer wants, and every firm willing to accept the market price can sell as much as it wants. Occasionally, consumers or firms persuade the government to intervene to try to lower or raise the market price of a good or service in three main ways: 1) imposing a price ceiling, 2) imposing a price floor, 3) imposing taxes.
- What Consumer Surplus and Producer Surplus Measure
	- Consumer surplus measures the *net* benefit to consumers from participating in a market rather than the *total* benefit. I.e., if the price of a product were zero, the consumer surplus in a market would be all of the area under the demand curve. When the price is not zero, consumer surplus is the area below the demand curve and above the market price. 
	- Producer surplus measures the *net* benefit received by producers from participating in a market. If producers could supply a good or service at zero cost, the producer surplus in a market would be all of the area below the market price. When cost is not zero, producer surplus is the area below the market price and above the supply curve. 
- Equilibrium in a competitive market results in an economically efficient level of output, at which marginal benefit equals marginal cost. 
- Equilibrium in a competitive market results in the greatest amount of economic surplus, or total net benefit to society, from the production of a good or service.
	- Anything that causes the market for a good or service not to be in competitive equilibrium reduces the total benefit to society from the production of that good or service. 
- The Results of Government Price Controls
	1. Some people win. I.e., the winners from rent control are the people who are paying less for rent because they live in rent-controlled apartments. Landlords may also gain if they break the law by charging rents above the legal maximum for their rent-controlled apartments, assuming the illegal rents are higher than the competitive equilibrium rents would be.
	2. Some people lose. I.e., the losers from rent control are the landlords of rent-controlled apartments who abide by the law and renters who are unable to find apartments to rent at the control price.
	3. There is a loss of economic efficiency. I.e., rent control reduces economic efficiency because fewer apartments are rented than would be rented in a competitive market. The resulting deadweight loss measures the decrease in economic efficiency. 
- The Effect of Taxes on Economic Efficiency
	- Whenever a government axes a good or service, less of that good or service will be produced and consumed. 
	- The true burden of a tax is not just the amount consumers and producers pay the government but also includes the deadweight loss. The deadweight loss from a tax is called the *excess burden* of the tax. 
		- A tax is efficient if it imposes a small excess burden relative to the tax revenue it raises.

##### Definitions

**Price ceiling:** a legally determined maximum price that sellers may charge.
**Price floor:** a legally determined minimum price that sellers may receive. 
**Consumer surplus:** the difference between the highest price a consumer is willing to pay for a good or service and the actual price the consumer pays.
**Marginal benefit:** the additional benefit to a consumer from consuming one more unit of a good or service. 
**Marginal cost:** the additional cost to a firm of producing one more unit of a good or service.
**Producer surplus:** the difference between the lowest price a firm would be willing to accept for a good or service and the price it actually receives.
**Economic surplus:** the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus.
**Deadweight loss:** the reduction in economic surplus resulting from a market not being in competitive equilibrium.
**Economic efficiency:** a market outcome in which the marginal benefit to consumers of the last unit produced is equal to its marginal cost of production and in which the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus is at a maximum.
**Black market:** a market in which buying and selling take place at prices that violate government price regulations. 
**Tax Incidence:** the actual division of the burden of a tax between buyers and sellers in a market.
