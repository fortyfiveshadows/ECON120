The Economics of Health Care
___
- Health care refers to goods or services, such as prescription drugs, consultations with a doctor, and surgeries, that are intended to maintain or improve a person's health. 
	- Health care makes up more than one-sixth of the U.S. economy (and approximately the size of the entire economy of France). 
	- Health care is provided through markets, just as are most other goods and services, such as smartphones and haircuts. Unlike other markets, the government plays a large part in health care. 
- Changes over Time in U.S. Health
	- When economists measure changes over time in the standard of living in a country, they usually look first at increases in income per person. However, changes in health are also important and considered. 
		- The three main indicators of health are 1) life expectancy at birth, 2) average height (adult males), 3) infant mortality (death of a child under 1 year of age)
- The U.S. Health Care System
	- Most people in the U.S. have *health insurance* which helps them pay their medical bills.
		- About 49% of people received health insurance through their employer, around 7% directly purchased an individual or family health insurance policy from an insurance company, often using the state health insurance marketplaces Congress established under the Affordable Care Act. About 35% of people received health insurance through a government program. Around 9% of people were not covered by health insurance in 2016. 
- The Health Care Systems of Canada, Japan, and the United Kingdom
	- Canada has a *single-payer healthcare system*. As in the U.S., most doctors and hospitals are private businesses, but unlike in the United States, doctors and hospitals are required to accept the fees that are set by the government. Also as in the U.S., doctors and hospitals are typically reimbursed on a fee-for-service basis.
	- Japan has a system of *universal health insurance* under which every resident of the country is required to enroll either in one of the many nonprofit insurance societies that are organized by industries or professions, or in the health insurance program provided by the national government. The system is funded by a combination of premiums paid by employees and firms and a payroll tax similar to the tax that funds the Medicare program in the U.S. Unlike the Canadian system, the Japanese system requires substantial *copayments*, under which patients pay as much as 30% of their medical bills, while health insurance pays for the rest. 
	- In the United Kingdom, the government owns nearly all hospitals and directly employs nearly all doctors. This type of system is typically categorized as *socialized medicine*. 
- Information Problems and Externalities in the Market for Health Care
	- Adverse Selection and the Market for "Lemons" 
		- If potential buyers of used cars know that they will have difficulty distinguishing good use cars from bad used cars, or "lemons," they will take this fact into account in the price they are willing to pay. 
			- E.g., suppose that half of the 2015 Honda Civics offered for sale have been well maintained and are good, reliable used cars. The other half have been poorly maintained and are lemons that will be unreliable. Suppose that potential buyers of 2016 Civics would be willing to pay $10,000 for a reliable one but only $5,000 for an unreliable one. The sellers know how well they have maintained their cars and whether they are reliable, but the buyers do not have this information and so have no way of distinguishing the reliable used cars from the unreliable ones. In this situation, buyers will generally offer a price somewhere between the price they would be willing to pay for a good car and the price they would be willing to pay for a lemon. With a 50-50 chance of buying a good car or a lemon, buyers might offer $7,500, which is halfway between the price they would pay in they knew for certain the car was good one and the price they would pay if they knew it was a lemon. Unfortunately for used car buyers, given that they don't know whether any particular car offered for sale is a good car of a lemon, their offer seems reasonable. However, the sellers do know whether the cars they are offering are good cars or lemons. To a seller of a good car, an offer of $7,500 is $2,500 below the true value of the car, and the seller will be reluctant to sell. To the seller of a lemon, however, an offer of $7,500 is $2,500 above the true value of the car, and the seller will be incentivized to sell. As sellers of lemons take advantage of knowing more about the cars they are selling than buyers do, buyers in the used car market will fall victim to *adverse selection*: most used cars offered for sale will be lemons. The problem of adverse selection reduces the total quantity of used cars bought and sold in the market because few good cars are offered for sale. 
	- Asymmetric Information in the Market for Health Insurance
		- Asymmetric information problems are particularly severe in the markets for all types of insurance, including health insurance.
			- Consider how insurance works: insurance companies provide the service of *risk pooling* when they sell policies to households. E.g., if you own a $150,000 house but do not have a fire insurance policy, a fire that destroys your house can be a financial catastrophe. An insurance company can pool the financial risk of your house burning down by selling fire insurance policies to you and thousands of other homeowners. Homeowners are willing to accept the certain cost represented by the premium they pay for insurance in return for eliminating the uncertain (by potentially catastrophic) cost should their house burn down.
		- For the insurance company to cover all its costs, the total amount it receives in premiums must be greater than the amount it pays out in claims to policy holders. To survive, insurance companies have to predict accuaretely the amount they are likely to pay out to policyholders. 
			- If an insurance company predicts that the houses of only 2% of policyholders will burn down during a year when 5% of houses actually burn down, the company will suffer losses. However, if the company predicts that 8% of houses will burn down when only 5% actually do, the company will have charged premiums that are too high. A company that charges premium that are too high will lose customers to other companies and may eventually be driven out of business. 
	- Adverse Selection in the Market for Health Insurance
		- Health insurance companies face a key obstacle to accurately predicting the number of claims policy-holders will make: buyers of health insurance policies always know more about the state of their health, and therefore how likely they are to submit medical bills for payment than the insurance companies. 
		- An insurance company faces a financial problem if the premiums it is charging are too low to cover the costs of the claims being submitted. However, if premiums rise, then younger, healthier people who rarely visit the doctor may respond to the increase in premiums by dropping their insurance. 
			- One way to deal with the problem of adverse selection is for the government to require every person to buy insurance. I.e., most state require all drivers to buy automobile insurance so that both high-risk and low-risk drivers will carry insurance. 
	- Moral Hazard in the Market for Health Insurance
		- The insurance market is subject to a second consequence of asymmetric information: moral hazard.
			- Moral hazard in the insurance market occurs when people change their behavior after becoming insured. 
				- I.e., managers become reluctant to install an expensive sprinkler system if they have fire insurance policy. 
		- One perspective of the moral hazard problem is to view that there are two parties to an economic transaction: the buyer and the seller. The insurance company becomes a third party to the purchase of medical services because the insurance company, rather than the patient, pays for some or all of the service. For this reason, economists refer to traditional health insurance as a *third-party payer system*. Due to this system, consumers of health care do not pay a price that reflects the full cost of providing the service. This lower price leads consumers more health care than they otherwise would.
