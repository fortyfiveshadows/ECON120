The Interaction of Demand and Supply
___
- The Law of Demand
	- The inverse relationship between the price of a product and the quantity of the product demanded is called the law of demand.
	- When the price of a product falls, consumers buy a larger quantity because of two effects:
		1. The *substitution effect*. E.g., when the price of premium bottled water falls, people will substitute buying premium bottled water for other goods, such as regular bottled water or carbonated soft drinks.
		2. The *income effect*. 
	- Although we can analyze them separately, the substitution effect and the income effect occur simultaneously whenever a price changes. 
	- The law of demand requires the *Ceteris Paribus* condition (hold everything else constant). Otherwise, it would shift the demand curve. 
- Variables That Shift Market Demand
	- There are five main variables outside of price that can influence market demand. 1) income, 2) prices of related goods, 3) tastes, 4) population and demographics, 5) expected future prices.
	1.  The income that consumers have available to spend affects their willingness and ability to buy a good. 
		- A good is a *normal good* when the demand for the good increases following a rise in income and decreases following a fall in income.
		- A good is an *inferior good* when the demand when the demand for it decreases following a rise in income and increases following a fall the income. 
	2. The price of related goods can also affect consumers' demand for a product. Goods and services that can be used for the same purpose are called *substitutes*. When two goods are substitutes, the more you buy of one, the less you will buy of the other. 
		- Goods and services that are used together (e.g., hot dogs and hot dog buns) are complements. When two goods are complements, the more consumers buy of one, the more they will buy of the other. A decrease in the price of a complement causes the demand curve for a good to shift to the right. An increase in the price of a complement causes the demand curve for a good to shift to the left.
	3. Economists say that advertising campaigns can affect a consumers' *taste* for a given good. Taste is a catchall category that refers to the many subjective elements that can enter into a consumer's decision to buy a product. Sometimes, trends can play a substantial role. 
		- Generally, when consumers' taste for a product increases, the demand curve will shift to the right, and when consumers' taste decreases, the demand curve will shift to the left.
	4. As the population of a country increases, the number of consumers will increase, as will the demand for most products. As the demographics of a country or region change, the demand for particular goods will increase or decrease because different categories of people tend to have different preferences for those goods.
	5. Consumers choose not only which products to buy, but also when to buy them. E.g., if enough consumers become convinced that houses will be selling for lower prices in three months, the demand for houses will decrease now, as some consumers postpone their purchases to wait for the expected price decrease, and vice versa.
- A Change in Demand vs. Change in Quantity Demanded
	- A change in demand refers to a shift of the demand curve. A shift occurs if there is a change in one of the variables (other than the price of the product!) that affects the willingness of consumers to buy the product. 
	- A change in quantity demanded refers to a movement along the demand curve as a result of a change in the product's price. 
- The Supply Side of the Market
	- Just as many variables influence the willingness and ability of consumers to buy a particular good or service, many variables influence the willingness and ability of firms to supply a good or service, the most important of which is price. Holding other variables constant, when the price of a good rises, producing the good is more profitable, and the quantity supplied will increase. When the price of a good falls, selling the good is less profitable, and the quantity supplied will decrease. 
- Variables That Shift Market Supply
	- There are five main variables that can shift market supply. 1) Prices of inputs, 2) Technological change, 3) Prices of related goods in production, 4) Number of firms in the market, 5) Expected future prices
	1. The factor most likely to cause the supply curve for a product to shift is a change in the price of an input. An *input* is anything used in the production of a good or service.
	2. Positive technological change occurs whenever a firm is able to produce more output using the same amount of inputs. Essentially, whenever the *productivity* of the firm's workers or machines has increased, which causes the market supply curve to shift to the right. On the other hand, negative technological change is relatively rare, but it can result from an earthquake, another natural disaster, or from anything that reduces the ability of firms to supply as much output with a given amount of inputs. Negative technological change will raise firms' costs, and firms will earn lower profits from the good, causing the market supply curve to shift to the left.
	3. Firms often choose which good or service they will produce. Alternative goods that a firm could produce are called *substitutes in production*. Goods that are produced together are called *complements in production*.
	4. A change in the number of firms in the market will change supply. When new firms enter a market, the supply curve shifts to the right, and when existing firms leave (exit) a market, the supply curve shifts to the left.
	5. If a firm expects that the price of its product will be higher in the future, it has an incentive to decrease supply now and increase it in the future, and vice versa.
- A Change in Supply vs. Change in Quantity Supplied
	- A change in supply refers to a shift of the supply curve, which will shift when there is a change in one of the variables (other than the price of the product) that affects the willingness of suppliers to sell the product. 
	- A change in quantity supplied refers to a movement along the supply curve as a result of a change in the product's price. If the price of an input decreases, or if another factor changes that causes sellers to supply more of a product at every price, the supply curve will shift to the right (increase in supply).
- How Markets Eliminate Surpluses and Shortages
	- A market that is not in equilibrium moves toward equilibrium. Once a market is in equilibrium, it remains in equilibrium. 
	- At a competitive market equilibrium, all consumers willing to pay the market price will be able to buy as much of the product as they want, and all firms willing to accept the market price will be able to sell as much of the product as they want.
	- Keep in mind that the interaction of demand and supply determines the equilibrium price. Neither consumers nor firms can dictate what the equilibrium price will be. No firm can sell anything at any price unless it can find a willing buyer, and no consumer can buy anything at any price without finding a willing seller. 
- The Effect of Demand and Supply Shifts on Equilibrium
	- The Effect of Shifts in Demand on Equilibrium
		- When the demand curve shifts to the left, both the equilibrium price and quantity will decrease, and vice versa.
	- The Effect of Shifts in Supply on Equilibrium
		- When the supply curve shifts to the left, it causes the equilibrium price to rise and the equilibrium quantity to fall, and vice versa.

##### Definitions
**Perfectly competitive market:** a market that meets the conditions of having (1) many buyers and sellers, (2) all firms selling identical products, and (3) no barriers to new firms entering the market. 
**Demand schedule:** a table that shows the relationship between the price of a product and the quantity of the product demanded.
